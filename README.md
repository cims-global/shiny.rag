## Run Shiny App

To run the Shiny app, please ensure all required packages listed at the top of the `shiny-demo.R` file are installed.

*Note: The `{ragnar}` package imports `{duckdb}`, which can take a significant amount of time to install. To better monitor the installation process, you may install `{duckdb}` first before installing `{ragnar}`.*

All API keys have been removed from the R code. Please insert them manually from your local files into the code.
